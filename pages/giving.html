                                <li>Wells Fargo team members volunteered 1.5 million hours and
                                    donated $70 million to nonprofits. </li>

                                You are invited, for the third year in a row, to cast a vote for one of four nonprofits (noted below)
                                that make a difference in  our local communities. Based on this poll held at our Wells Fargo Sibos reception,
                                Wells Fargo will donate a total of USD$10,000 to these four charities.</p>

                                        on the charitable project than I&rsquo;d have if I were to donate on my own.
                                        Our selected charity and its beneficiaries receive their much needed financial support,
                                        whilst I have gained experience in team-work and negotiation skills.
                                        I have also met like-minded people who have become friends through sharing the same values
