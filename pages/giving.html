                                that make a difference in  our local communities. Based on this poll held at our Wells Fargo Sibos reception,

                                        on the charitable project than I&rsquo;d have if I were to donate on my own.
                                        Our selected charity and its beneficiaries receive their much needed financial support,
                                        whilst I have gained experience in team-work and negotiation skills.
                                        I have also met like-minded people who have become friends through sharing the same values
                                        whilst supporting our dedicated mission to help people less privileged.&rdquo;</em></p>
